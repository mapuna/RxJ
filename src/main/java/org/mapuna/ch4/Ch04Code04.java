/**
 * Maybe is a stream that can emit 0 or 1 item. It is useful because Single canâ€™t emit null
 * (null is an illegal value). Maybe observers are notified:
 * - when a value is emitted using the onSuccess method,
 * - when the stream complete, without a value using the onComplete method,
 * - when an error is thrown using the onError method
 * Notice the subtlety about onSuccess and onComplete.
 * The first one is called when there is a value. The second one is called when there is not.
