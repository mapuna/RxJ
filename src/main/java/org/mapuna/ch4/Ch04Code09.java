/**
 * So far, we have seen examples of streams that were pushing items to subscribers.
 * However, there is an issue with this model. If your consumer cannot keep up with
 * the pace, something bad is going to happen. Putting a buffer in between will
 * only handle small bumps.
 *
 * This is where back-pressure comes into the picture. But first, letâ€™s illustrate
 * the example.
 *
 * We create a stream of integers and display them in the subscribe method after
 * a small nap.
