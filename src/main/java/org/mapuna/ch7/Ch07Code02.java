/**
 * Synchronous emission is not much of a problem when no latency is involved, i.e when the operations
 * only involve pure computation and donâ€™t involve operations that will pause the thread of execution.
 *
 * However, when an operation has latency, the synchronous emission will impose this latency to the
 * subscribing thread like we can see in this example. We can see that the artificial delay in the
 * emission impacts the application code that receives the items.
