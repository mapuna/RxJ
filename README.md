Interesting things are in packages org.mapuna.{ch4, ch5, ch6, ch7, ch8}:
1. In ch4, we create streams.
2. In ch5, we apply operators.
3. In ch6, we create new APIs from a. other Rx APIs (code listing Ch06Code01 to Ch06Code07), b. from other Async but non-Rx APIs (code listing Ch06Code07), c. from other non-async source (code listing Ch06Code08). We also explore some intricacies of Rx APIs thereafter, and converting blocking code to Rx.
